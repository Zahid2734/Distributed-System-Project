Langugage : Python 2.7 
System : Ubuntu 18.04 Folders:
1. Single SERVER-CLIENT model: Single_Server.py, Client1.py, Client2.py 
2. Multi SERVER-CLIENT model: Multi_Client_Server.py, Client1.py, Client2.py
3. RPC model: RPC_Server.py, RPC_Client.py
4. Asynchronous RPC: Asynchronous_Server.py, Asynchronous_Client.py 
5. Deferred Synchronous RPC: Deferred_Synchronous_Server.py, Deferred_Synchronous_Client.py 

# Instructions: For Single SERVER-CLIENT model and Multi-SERVER-CLIENT model 
1. For Single SERVER-CLIENT model and Multi SERVER-CLIENT model, please change the Server_Directory and Client_Directory as per their directory in your system and compile them. [better to keep client and server in different folders to see better output] 
2. Open terminals, first for server and then for client. 
3. Run server in one terminal. 
4. Run client in another. 
5. Follow instructions in client terminal. 
6. Check output in server and client folders. 

# For RPC model, Asynchronous RPC and Deferred Synchronous: 
Please import all modules specially math, numpy. Run the server and client in different terminals.
